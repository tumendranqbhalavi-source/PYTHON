It is used when you want to define a common structure that other subclasses must follow, but you don’t want the base class itself to be used for creating objects. Abstract classes are defined using the `abc` (Abstract Base Class) module, and they can contain **abstract methods**, which are methods declared but not implemented in the base class. Any subclass that inherits from an abstract class is required to provide its own implementation of these abstract methods; otherwise, it too becomes abstract and cannot be instantiated. The main purpose of abstract classes is to enforce a certain structure in subclasses, promote code reusability, and ensure that essential methods are always implemented. For example, if an abstract class `Animal` has an abstract method `sound()`, then subclasses like `Dog` and `Cat` must implement the `sound()` method in their own way. This ensures consistency across all subclasses while still allowing flexibility in how they implement the required behavior.\n"

For example, if one parent class handles input/output operations and another handles mathematical operations, a child class can inherit from both and use their features together. However, multiple inheritance can sometimes lead to confusion if two parent classes have methods with the same name. To resolve such conflicts, Python follows a specific order called the Method Resolution Order (MRO), which decides which parent’s method should be used first.

The purpose of this method is to handle cleanup tasks such as closing files, releasing memory, or disconnecting from databases before the object is removed from memory. For example, if an object is managing a file, the __del__ method can ensure that the file is properly closed once the object is no longer needed. However, it is important to note that relying solely on __del__ is not always safe, because the exact time of object destruction is handled by Python’s garbage collector, which may delay or skip calling it in some cases. Therefore, while __del__ is useful for cleanup, developers often prefer using context managers (with statement) for more reliable resource management."

Since it doesn’t take the `self` or `cls` parameter, it cannot access or modify instance variables or class variables directly. On the other hand, a `@classmethod` is a method that receives the class itself as the first argument, usually named `cls`. This allows it to access and modify class-level attributes that are shared across all instances of the class.

This is usually achieved through **method overriding**, where the child class defines a method with the same name as the parent class, but with different or extended behavior. For example, if a parent class `Animal` has a method `sound()`, and subclasses like `Dog` and `Cat` override this method to return “Woof” and “Meow” respectively, then when `sound()` is called on an `Animal` reference pointing to a `Dog` object, the dog’s version of the method is executed. This demonstrates the principle of “one interface, many implementations,” allowing the same method call to behave differently based on the object’s class. Polymorphism in inheritance makes code more flexible and extensible, since new child classes can be added without changing existing code that depends on the parent class interface.\n",

        "Ans= In Python OOP, **method chaining** is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line, one after another. This works because each method returns the object itself (`self`), allowing another method to be called immediately on the returned object. For example, in a class `Person`, if the methods `setName()`, `setAge()`, and `setCity()` all return `self`, then we can write `p.setName(\"Alice\").setAge(20).setCity(\"Paris\")` instead of calling them separately. The main significance of method chaining is that it makes the code shorter, cleaner, and more readable by combining multiple operations into a single expression, while still maintaining object-oriented principles.\n",

        "Ans= In Python, the **`__call__` method** allows an object of a class to be used as if it were a function. When you define `__call__` inside a class, creating an instance of that class makes it possible to “call” the instance directly using parentheses, just like calling a normal function. The main purpose of `__call__` is to give objects function-like behavior while still keeping them as objects with state and attributes. For example, you might create a class that processes numbers and by implementing `__call__`, you can pass input to the object as though it were a function. This is useful in situations like building decorators, machine learning models, or objects that need to behave dynamically. In short, `__call__` bridges the gap between functions and objects, making objects more flexible and powerful in Python.\n",
