        " Ans= The logging module in Python is used to record messages from your program while it is running. Instead of just using print() for debugging, logging provides a better and more professional way to keep track of events, errors, or important information. It allows you to set different levels like DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL, so you can decide what kind of messages to show or save. You can also store these logs in a file for later use, which makes it easier to find problems and understand what happened in your program over time."

Using this module, you can create, delete, rename, or check if a file or folder exists. It also lets you navigate through directories, get file information, and manage file paths. In short, the os module provides useful functions that make it easier to control and organize files and folders directly from your Python program."

        "Ans= The main challenges associated with memory management in Python come from the fact that memory is managed automatically by the interpreter using reference counting and garbage collection. Sometimes, this can create issues. For example, if objects keep referring to each other (circular references), memory may not be released properly. Also, large data structures or unnecessary variables kept in memory can lead to memory leaks and slow performance. Since Python hides low-level memory details from the programmer, it can be harder to control memory usage compared to languages like C. Therefore, writing efficient code and cleaning up unused objects is important to avoid performance problems."

        "Ans=  In Python, you can raise an exception manually using the raise keyword. This is done when you want to signal that something unexpected has happened in your program, even if Python itself has not detected an error. For example, if a certain condition is not valid, you can raise an exception like ValueError or TypeError with a custom message. This helps in making your program more reliable and easier to debug, because it clearly shows where and why the error occurred. In simple words, raising an exception is a way for the programmer to stop the normal flow of the program and indicate that something went wrong."

        "Ans= Multithreading is important in certain applications because it allows a program to do **multiple tasks at the same time**, which improves efficiency and responsiveness. For example, in a web browser, one thread can load images while another handles user input, so the program does not freeze. Similarly, in applications that deal with large amounts of data or I/O operations (like downloading files, handling multiple clients in a server, or running background tasks), multithreading makes the process faster and smoother. It also helps in better utilization of CPU resources by running tasks concurrently. In short, multithreading is important when you want your application to be **faster, more responsive, and able to handle multiple operations simultaneously**.\n"
